          We try to give accurate product descriptions and pictures, but we
          can't promise that everything on our website is correct or up to date.
          Additionally, there may be issues with the colour or measurements,
          which may be very little from the actual products due to differences
          in the screen and the home nature of some objects. These issues may
          arise because genuine products may look different on different
          screens.
